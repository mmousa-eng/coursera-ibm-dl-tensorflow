## 📝 Final Project: Waste Classification with Transfer Learning  
This is the final project from the Coursera course **"Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow"** by IBM.  

## 🔍 Project Summary  
The goal was to develop an AI model that can automatically classify waste products.  

## 📁 Files  
- `waste_classification.ipynb` – Contains the full implementation, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- `waste_images.zip` – Dataset used for training and testing the model.
